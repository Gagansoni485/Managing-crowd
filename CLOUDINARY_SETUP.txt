CLOUDINARY SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

Your Cloudinary Credentials:
- Cloud Name: dgvxbabux
- API Key: 537953111953213
- API Secret: 8FARQMNojMu64pVXj6nGUmD1cXQ

IMPORTANT: Set up Unsigned Upload Preset
-----------------------------------------

1. Go to https://cloudinary.com/console
2. Login with your account
3. Navigate to Settings > Upload
4. Scroll down to "Upload presets"
5. Click "Add upload preset"
6. Set the following:
   - Preset name: ml_default (or any name you prefer)
   - Signing mode: Unsigned
   - Folder: visitors (optional, to organize uploads)
   - Click "Save"

7. If you use a different preset name, update it in:
   frontend/src/pages/Register.jsx
   Line ~45: formData.append('upload_preset', 'YOUR_PRESET_NAME');

Current Implementation:
-----------------------
✓ User model updated with profileImage field
✓ Register component handles image upload for visitors
✓ Image uploaded to Cloudinary before registration
✓ Cloudinary URL saved in MongoDB
✓ Image preview shown before upload
✓ Form validation ensures visitors upload profile image

How It Works:
-------------
1. Visitor selects an image during registration
2. Image preview is shown immediately
3. When form is submitted:
   - Image is uploaded to Cloudinary
   - Cloudinary returns secure URL
   - URL is sent to backend with registration data
   - URL is stored in MongoDB User model

Security Note:
--------------
For production, consider:
- Implementing signed uploads from backend
- Adding file size validation
- Adding file type validation
- Implementing image optimization
